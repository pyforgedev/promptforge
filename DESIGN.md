version: 1.3.0
name: PromptForge-design-system
description: >
  A high-performance, IDE-inspired design language for an AI Prompt Engineering
  application. The aesthetic blends the cinematic restraint of professional
  creative tools with the ultra-fast, precision-driven feel of modern developer
  environments. Strict light/dark semantic color system, seamless text
  streaming, mandatory glassmorphism for overlays, and accessibility as a
  non-negotiable baseline rather than an afterthought.
---

## Overview

PromptForge is an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for prompt
engineers. The UI is strictly functional, optimizing for reading density and
rapid interaction. It avoids heavy shadows and excessive color in favor of a
precise, high-contrast monochrome base paired with a small set of semantic
accents.

**Key characteristics:**

- **Developer-centric typography** — UI chrome uses `Geist` (sans-serif); generated
  prompts and quality scores use `JetBrains Mono` / `Geist Mono` to read like data,
  not prose.
- **Motion & speed** — the UI must feel instantaneous: streaming text for
  outputs, skeletons for pending data, no spinners.
- **Flat depth, glass overlays** — cards are flat with thin borders. Elevation
  is communicated exclusively through glassmorphism + a strict z-index scale,
  never through drop shadows on resting surfaces.
- **Accessible by default** — every rule below assumes the result must be
  usable with a keyboard, a screen reader, and `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce`.
  This is not optional polish; treat it as a build requirement same as TypeScript
  passing.

## 1. Design Tokens

### 1.1 Color — semantic roles

Never reference a color by its role's *value*. Reference it by *role*. The
table below is the contract between design and code; the actual hex values
live in §2 so they can change without anyone hunting through components.

| Token | Used for |
|---|---|
| `brand-primary` | Primary actions, active states, focus ring, links |
| `brand-primary-hover` | Hover/active state of primary actions |
| `brand-success` | Copy-success, valid states, positive deltas |
| `brand-warning` | Non-blocking warnings (e.g. "similar to a recent prompt") |
| `brand-danger` | Errors, destructive actions, invalid form state |
| `text-on-brand` | Text/icons placed on top of any filled brand-* surface |
| `bg-app` | Outermost page background |
| `bg-surface` | Cards, panels, inputs |
| `bg-surface-hover` | Hover state of interactive surfaces |
| `bg-overlay` | Glass background for dropdowns/modals/toasts (see §4) |
| `text-primary` | Default body/heading text |
| `text-secondary` | De-emphasized text (labels, helper text) |
| `text-muted` | Placeholder, disabled, timestamps |
| `border-subtle` | Default card/input borders |
| `border-strong` | Overlay rings, dividers that must read clearly |
| `border-danger` | Invalid input border |

> `brand-danger` and `text-on-brand` are new in v1.1 — the previous version had
> no error color and no explicit rule for text-on-color, which is why error
> states in the generator form were inconsistent.

### 1.2 Typography

| Role | Family | Size | Weight | Line-height | Tracking |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `display` | Geist | 36px | 800 | 1.15 | -0.03em |
| `heading` | Geist | 20px | 600 | 1.3 | -0.015em |
| `body` | Geist | 15px | 400 | 1.5 | — |
| `label` | Geist | 13px | 500 | 1.4 | — |
| `caption` | Geist | 12px | 500 | 1.4 | 0.01em |
| `body-mono` | JetBrains Mono / Geist Mono | 14px | 400 | 1.6 | 0 |
| `metric-score` | JetBrains Mono / Geist Mono | 24px | 600 | 1.0 | -0.02em |

`caption` is new — use it for timestamps, item counts, and metadata in
`HistoryList`, instead of reusing `label` at a smaller size.

**Font features:** Geist OpenType features are enabled via
`font-feature-settings: 'cv02', 'cv03', 'cv04', 'cv11'` for refined
typographic control. **Font smoothing** is applied globally:
`-webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased` and `-moz-osx-font-smoothing: grayscale`.

### 1.3 Spacing, radius, elevation

| Spacing | xs | sm | md | lg | xl | xxl |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| px | 4 | 8 | 16 | 24 | 32 | 48 |

| Radius | none | sm | md | lg | xl | full |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| px | 0 | 6 | 8 | 12 | 16 | 9999 |

| Z-index layer | Value | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `z-grain` | 1 | Grain/noise overlay (below all content) |
| `z-base` | 0 | Default page content |
| `z-sticky` | 10 | Sticky headers/toolbars |
| `z-dropdown` | 20 | Select menus, popovers |
| `z-drawer` | 30 | Mobile sidebar drawer |
| `z-modal` | 40 | Dialogs |
| `z-toast` | 50 | Copy/duplicate-warning toasts |

The grain overlay (`z-grain: 1`) is a fixed-position texture layer that renders
above the background (`z-base` defaults to 0 via stacking context) but below
all interactive content (`z-sticky` and above). This ensures it never visually
interferes with dropdowns, modals, or toasts.

Every floating element gets its z-index from this table — no ad hoc `z-[999]`
in component code. This avoids the classic bug where a toast renders behind a
modal.

### 1.4 Motion

| Token | Duration | Easing | Use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `motion-fast` | 120ms | `ease-out` | Hover/active feedback, icon swaps |
| `motion-base` | 200ms | `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` | Panel open/close, accordion |
| `motion-slow` | 320ms | `cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1)` | Drawer slide-in, modal entrance |
| `motion-stream` | per-character, no easing | — | Text streaming (see §6.2) |

**Stagger animations:** Use the `animate-stagger-*` utility classes for
sequential entry animations. Each class applies a `slide-up-fade` keyframe
animation with incremental delays:

| Class | Delay |
|---|---|
| `animate-stagger-1` | 0ms |
| `animate-stagger-2` | 60ms |
| `animate-stagger-3` | 120ms |
| `animate-stagger-4` | 180ms |

```css
@keyframes slide-up-fade {
  from { opacity: 0; transform: translateY(10px); }
  to { opacity: 1; transform: translateY(0); }
}
.animate-stagger-1 { animation: slide-up-fade 350ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) 0ms forwards; }
.animate-stagger-2 { animation: slide-up-fade 350ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) 60ms forwards; }
.animate-stagger-3 { animation: slide-up-fade 350ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) 120ms forwards; }
.animate-stagger-4 { animation: slide-up-fade 350ms cubic-bezier(0.4, 0, 0.2, 1) 180ms forwards; }
```

**Button press:** The `btn-press` class applies tactile feedback on `:active`:
`transform: scale(0.98) translateY(1px)`. Use on primary action buttons.

**Reduced motion is mandatory, not optional:** wrap non-essential motion
(drawer slides, accordion expand, hover scale) in a check against
`prefers-reduced-motion`, and fall back to an opacity-only or instant
transition. Streaming text may keep appearing instantly (no animation) rather
than character-by-character when reduced motion is requested — the content
still needs to appear, just without the animated reveal.

```tsx
const shouldReduceMotion = useReducedMotion(); // from framer-motion
transition={shouldReduceMotion ? { duration: 0 } : baseTransition}
```

### 1.5 Breakpoints

| Token | Min-width | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `sm` | 640px | — |
| `md` | 768px | Sidebar still collapsible |
| `lg` | 1024px | Sidebar becomes persistent (no drawer) |
| `xl` | 1280px | Max content width reached |

These match Tailwind's defaults intentionally — don't override Tailwind's
breakpoint scale in `tailwind.config.js` unless there's a specific reason
documented here.

---

## 2. Color Values & Implementation

### 2.1 Reference hex values

These are the actual colors behind the tokens in §1.1. Both columns are
calibrated for **WCAG AA**: body text ≥ 4.5:1 against its background,
large/bold text and icons ≥ 3:1. If you change a value, re-check contrast —
don't eyeball it.

| Token | Light | Dark |
|---|---|---|
| `brand-primary` | `#2F6FE0` | `#5B8DF8` |
| `brand-primary-hover` | `#2558B8` | `#7AA3FA` |
| `brand-success` | `#15803D` | `#22C55E` |
| `brand-warning` | `#B45309` | `#F59E0B` |
| `brand-danger` | `#DC2626` | `#EF4444` |
| `text-on-brand` | `#FFFFFF` | `#FFFFFF` |
| `bg-app` | `#FAFAFA` | `#0B0D10` |
| `bg-surface` | `#FFFFFF` | `#15181C` |
| `bg-surface-hover` | `#F1F2F4` | `#1E2227` |
| `text-primary` | `#111317` | `#F3F4F6` |
| `text-secondary` | `#4B5563` | `#9CA3AF` |
| `text-muted` | `#9CA3AF` | `#6B7280` |
| `border-subtle` | `#E5E7EB` | `#2A2E34` |
| `border-strong` | `#D1D5DB` | `#3A3F46` |
| `border-danger` | `#FCA5A5` | `#7F1D1D` |

`brand-primary`, `brand-success`, and `brand-danger` are intentionally a shade
brighter in dark mode — the same hex value reads as duller against a near-black
background, which is why "accent consistency" in the old doc (same hex in
both modes) was technically wrong. Same *role*, calibrated value per mode.

### 2.2 CSS variables (required format)

Define variables as **raw RGB channels**, not hex strings. This is required
for Tailwind's `/<opacity>` modifier (e.g. `bg-surface/80`, already used for
`overlay-glass` in §4) to work — a hex string in a CSS variable cannot be
given an opacity modifier by Tailwind directly.

```css
/* globals.css */
:root {
  --brand-primary: 47 111 224;
  --brand-primary-hover: 37 88 184;
  --brand-success: 21 128 61;
  --brand-warning: 180 83 9;
  --brand-danger: 220 38 38;
  --text-on-brand: 255 255 255;

  --bg-app: 250 250 250;
  --bg-surface: 255 255 255;
  --bg-surface-hover: 241 242 244;
  --text-primary: 17 19 23;
  --text-secondary: 75 85 99;
  --text-muted: 156 163 175;
  --border-subtle: 229 231 235;
  --border-strong: 209 213 219;
  --border-danger: 252 165 165;
}

[data-theme="dark"] {
  --brand-primary: 91 141 248;
  --brand-primary-hover: 122 163 250;
  --brand-success: 34 197 94;
  --brand-warning: 245 158 11;
  --brand-danger: 239 68 68;

  --bg-app: 11 13 16;
  --bg-surface: 21 24 28;
  --bg-surface-hover: 30 34 39;
  --text-primary: 243 244 246;
  --text-secondary: 156 163 175;
  --text-muted: 107 114 128;
  --border-subtle: 42 46 52;
  --border-strong: 58 63 70;
  --border-danger: 127 29 29;
}
```

### 2.3 Tailwind config

```js
// tailwind.config.js
function withOpacity(variable) {
  return ({ opacityValue }) =>
    opacityValue === undefined
      ? `rgb(var(${variable}))`
      : `rgb(var(${variable}) / ${opacityValue})`;
}

module.exports = {
  darkMode: ["selector", '[data-theme="dark"]'],
  theme: {
    extend: {
      colors: {
        "brand-primary": withOpacity("--brand-primary"),
        "brand-primary-hover": withOpacity("--brand-primary-hover"),
        "brand-success": withOpacity("--brand-success"),
        "brand-warning": withOpacity("--brand-warning"),
        "brand-danger": withOpacity("--brand-danger"),
        "text-on-brand": withOpacity("--text-on-brand"),
        "bg-app": withOpacity("--bg-app"),
        "bg-surface": withOpacity("--bg-surface"),
        "bg-surface-hover": withOpacity("--bg-surface-hover"),
        "text-primary": withOpacity("--text-primary"),
        "text-secondary": withOpacity("--text-secondary"),
        "text-muted": withOpacity("--text-muted"),
        "border-subtle": withOpacity("--border-subtle"),
        "border-strong": withOpacity("--border-strong"),
        "border-danger": withOpacity("--border-danger"),
      },
    },
  },
};
```

This makes `bg-surface`, `bg-surface/80`, `text-danger`, `border-danger/50`,
etc. all work as plain Tailwind utilities — no custom CSS needed in
components, which is what rule §3.1 below depends on.

> If this project is on Tailwind v4, the equivalent is an `@theme` block in
> CSS using the same `rgb(var(--x) / <alpha-value>)` pattern — the token names
> and rgb-channel format stay identical, only the wiring location changes.

## 3. Light/Dark Theme Strict Rules

1. **Never hardcode hex or named colors** in components (`bg-[#111827]`,
   `text-white`, `text-gray-400`). Always use the semantic classes from §2.3.
2. **Root theme management** via `data-theme="dark" | "light"` on `<html>`.
   Variables invert automatically per §2.2 — components never branch on theme
   in JS to pick a color.
3. **Text on brand surfaces** always uses `text-on-brand` (`#FFFFFF` in both
   modes) — never `text-primary`, which inverts and would become unreadable
   on a colored button in dark mode.
4. **Border contrast must hold in both modes.** `border-subtle` is intentionally
   low-contrast (separates surfaces without visual noise); `border-strong` and
   `border-danger` must stay clearly visible against `bg-surface` in both modes
   — verify visually after any value change, don't assume the same ratio holds.
5. **Test every new component in both themes before merging.** This was a rule
   in v1.0 and remains one — it's the cheapest bug class to prevent and the
   easiest to skip under deadline pressure.

---

## 4. 🚨 Critical Rule: Overlays & Transparency (Glassmorphism)

Pure transparency on floating elements (dropdowns, modals, tooltips, sticky
headers) is forbidden — it causes background text to visually clash with
foreground content.

Every floating element uses the `overlay-glass` pattern:

- **Background:** `bg-surface/80` (80% opacity surface color — relies on the
  RGB-channel CSS variables in §2.2).
- **Blur:** `backdrop-blur-md` (`backdrop-filter: blur(12px)`).
- **Border:** `border border-strong` to define the edge against the blur.
- **Elevation:** the matching `z-*` token from §1.3 — not an arbitrary value.

```html
<div class="bg-surface/80 backdrop-blur-md border border-strong shadow-xl z-dropdown rounded-md">
```

---

## 5. Accessibility (Non-Negotiable Baseline)

These were missing in v1.0 and are the most common source of real bugs (the
raw-`<button>` accordion in `GeneratorForm.tsx` losing ARIA semantics is a
direct example of what this section prevents going forward).

1. **Use Radix/Shadcn primitives for interactive patterns** (`Accordion`,
   `Dialog`, `Popover`, `Select`, `Tooltip`) instead of hand-rolled
   `<div onClick>` or raw `<button>` toggles. They ship correct ARIA roles,
   focus trapping, and keyboard handling for free — don't reimplement it.
2. **Visible focus is mandatory.** Every interactive element gets a visible
   `focus-visible` ring using `brand-primary`, e.g.
   `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-brand-primary focus-visible:ring-offset-2`.
   Never `outline-none` without a replacement focus style.
3. **Color is never the only signal.** An error state pairs `border-danger`
   with an icon and text, not just a red border — the duplicate-detection
   warning (see §6.4) follows this too: icon + text + color, not color alone.
4. **Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`** per §1.4 for every animation that
   isn't strictly necessary to convey state.
5. **Contrast is checked, not assumed.** Any new color value added to §2.1
   gets verified against the AA targets stated there before merging.
6. **Touch targets ≥ 40px** on interactive elements in mobile/drawer contexts
   (action bar icon buttons, close buttons).

---

## 6. Typography Strategy

- **UI labels & navigation:** `label` token (Geist, 13px, Medium) — keeps
  interface chrome minimal and out of the way.
- **The "Prompt" text:** the most important element on screen, uses
  `body-mono`. Monospace gives it a code-block feel, making syntax like
  `--v 6.0` or `--ar 16:9` easy to scan.
- **Quality Score:** `metric-score` — large, bold monospace numbers, so the
  evaluation reads as an exact computation rather than a soft opinion.
- **Metadata/timestamps:** `caption` (§1.2), never reuse `label` at a smaller
  font-size override.

---

## 6.1 Iconography

- **Library:** `lucide-react` exclusively — don't mix in another icon set,
  stroke weights won't match.
- **Stroke width:** `1.75` as the project default (slightly heavier than
  Lucide's default `2` reads better at small UI sizes against this typeface).
- **Sizes:** `16px` inline with `label`/`body` text, `20px` in standalone
  buttons/action bars, `24px` for empty-state illustrations.
- **Color:** icons inherit `currentColor` — never hardcode an icon fill/stroke
  color separately from the text it sits beside.
- **Sidebar navigation:** nav items use `tracking-tight` for tighter label
  spacing alongside the icon.

## 6.2 Streaming Output Panel

- On "Generate", the output panel appears immediately with a blinking cursor.
- As `stream: true` data arrives, characters append in `body-mono`.
- **Skeleton loading:** while streaming, "AI Quality Score" shows a pulsing
  box (`animate-pulse bg-border-subtle`). The numeric score replaces it only
  once the stream completes.
- Under reduced motion, skip the pulse animation and show a static placeholder
  block instead.

## 6.3 Action Bars & Copy Buttons

- Hovering a generated prompt reveals a ghost-style action bar.
- **Copy:** icon → checkmark, text → `brand-success`, glass toast
  ("Prompt copied") at `z-toast`. Reverts after 2s.

## 6.4 Form Validation & Error States

New in v1.1 — directly addresses the missing-translation-key and error-handling
issues found in code review.

- **Invalid input:** `border-danger` border, `brand-danger` helper text below
  the field, plus a small danger-colored icon — never border color alone.
- **API/provider errors** (`generator.form.errors.*`): rendered as an inline
  banner using the `overlay-glass` background but with a `border-danger`
  accent edge (left border, 3px, `brand-danger`) — distinct enough from a
  generic glass dropdown that users register it as an error, not a menu.
- **Error copy** states what happened and what to do next in the interface's
  voice — e.g. "Couldn't reach the prompt provider. Check your connection and
  retry," not "PROVIDER_ERROR" or a bare exclamation mark.

## 6.5 Duplicate-Detection Warning (Badge & Banner)

New in v1.1 — UI spec for the feature being implemented separately; defined
here so it's built with existing tokens instead of one-off styles.

- **Badge** (on a result that's flagged similar): pill shape (`rounded-full`),
  `brand-warning` text on `brand-warning/10` background, `12px` icon + caption
  text, e.g. "Similar to a recent prompt."
- **Banner** (if surfaced more prominently): same `overlay-glass` + left-accent
  pattern as §6.4 but with `brand-warning` instead of `brand-danger`, since
  this is a non-blocking warning, not an error.
- Always pair the badge/banner with an action ("Regenerate" or "Keep anyway")
  — per §5.3, color/icon alone is not sufficient, and an unfollowable warning
  is worse than no warning.

## 6.6 Empty States

- An empty `HistoryList` is an invitation to act, not just a blank panel:
  state what's missing and what to do — e.g. "No prompts yet. Generate your
  first one to see it here," with a button that returns focus to the
  generator input, not a static illustration with no path forward.

## 6.7 Switch / Toggle

New in v1.1 — this pattern previously shipped with no spec at all, which led
to a real bug: toggles rendered with the unstyled primitive default (plain
white when on, bare outline when off) instead of the project's actual
`brand-primary`, making on/off states nearly impossible to tell apart at a
glance. The rule below exists specifically to prevent that regression.

- **On (checked):** track filled `brand-primary` (the project's blue accent
  — see §2.1; never a generic white/light fill), knob `text-on-brand` for
  guaranteed contrast against the filled track.
- **Off (unchecked):** track `bg-surface-hover` with a visible `border-subtle`
  edge — not fully transparent — knob filled `text-secondary` (a solid
  circle, not just an outline) so it stays visible against a dark `bg-app`.
- **Position is a secondary signal, not the primary one.** Knob position
  (left/right) reinforces state but color is what should register first —
  per §5.3, never rely on position alone the way the unstyled version did.
- **Disabled:** track and knob both drop to 50% opacity (`opacity-50`),
  `cursor-not-allowed` — keep the same on/off color logic underneath so the
  state is still legible, just muted.
- **Focus:** `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-brand-primary
  focus-visible:ring-offset-2`, per §5.2 — toggles are keyboard-operable
  controls, not decorative switches.
- **Implementation:** use the Radix/Shadcn `Switch` primitive (per §5.1) and
  override its default `checked`/`unchecked` classes to the tokens above —
  don't hand-roll a custom switch, and don't leave the primitive's default
  (un-themed) colors in place.

```tsx
<Switch
  className="data-[state=checked]:bg-brand-primary data-[state=unchecked]:bg-surface-hover data-[state=unchecked]:border data-[state=unchecked]:border-subtle"
/>
```

## 6.8 Tooltip

New in v1.1 — added because several icon-only buttons in the app currently
have no accessible label at all, visual or otherwise. A tooltip is the
visual half of the fix; it is not a substitute for the other half.

- **Every icon-only button gets an `aria-label`** describing the action
  (e.g. `"Copy prompt"`, `"Delete from history"`) — this is required
  regardless of whether a tooltip is attached. Screen readers don't read
  tooltips, and tooltips don't appear on touch devices (no hover state), so
  the label is the part that actually has to carry the meaning.
- **Primitive:** Radix/Shadcn `Tooltip` (per §5.1) — don't hand-roll one.
  It shows on keyboard focus as well as hover, which a custom
  `onMouseEnter` implementation typically misses.
- **Tooltips are floating elements** — per §4, they're subject to the same
  glassmorphism rule as dropdowns and modals. The shadcn default ships
  `TooltipContent` as a solid `bg-primary` block; override it to the
  `overlay-glass` pattern so it doesn't diverge from the rest of the system.
- **Delay:** `delayDuration={300}` on the `TooltipProvider` — long enough to
  not fire on every incidental hover while scanning the toolbar, short
  enough to still feel responsive (`motion-base`, §1.4).
- **Copy:** short, verb-led, matches the actual action — "Copy prompt," not
  "Copy" alone if there's more than one copy-able thing on screen.

```tsx
<TooltipProvider delayDuration={300}>
  <Tooltip>
    <TooltipTrigger asChild>
      <Button variant="ghost" size="icon" aria-label="Copy prompt">
        <Copy className="size-4" />
      </Button>
    </TooltipTrigger>
    <TooltipContent className="bg-surface/80 backdrop-blur-md border border-strong text-text-primary">
      Copy prompt
    </TooltipContent>
  </Tooltip>
</TooltipProvider>
```

## 6.9 Dual-Mode Select

New in v1.2 — a specialized pattern for fields that can be either "user pinned"
(constant across a batch) or "system driven" (included in the variation pool).

- **Structure:** Two segmented buttons ("User Defined" / "System Defined") as a
  toggle, followed by a conditional combobox that appears only when "User Defined"
  is selected.
- **Segmented buttons:** `SegmentGroup` or two `Toggle` buttons grouped together.
  Active segment uses `brand-primary` background with `text-on-brand`; inactive
  uses `bg-surface-hover` with `text-secondary`. The segments are separated by a
  thin `border-subtle` divider, not spaced apart.
- **Combobox conditional:** When "User Defined" is active, show a `Combobox`
  (Radix/Shadcn) below the segmented control. When "System Defined" is active,
  hide the combobox — the field will be handled by the variation engine.
- **Empty value handling:** If the user selects "none" (or "no_people" for human
  models) in User Defined mode, the field is treated as "excluded" — the prompt
  will not mention that attribute at all. This is distinct from "System Defined"
  where the engine picks a value from the pool.
- **Why not a Switch:** This pattern needs three states (User Pinned / User
  Excluded / System Driven) that a simple on/off toggle cannot represent cleanly.
  The segmented control makes the user's intent explicit without ambiguity.
- **Focus:** `focus-visible:ring-2 focus-visible:ring-brand-primary
  focus-visible:ring-offset-2` on both the segmented buttons and the combobox
  trigger.
- **Implementation:** Use Radix/Shadcn `ToggleGroup` for the mode selector and
  `Combobox` for the value selector. Wire the conditional visibility to the mode
  state — show the combobox only when `mode === 'user'`.

```tsx
<FieldRow label="Mood" htmlFor="mood-mode">
  <ToggleGroup
    type="single"
    value={field.mode}
    onValueChange={(val) => field.onChange({ ...field, mode: val as 'user' | 'system' })}
    className="flex gap-0"
  >
    <ToggleGroupItem

## 6.11 Scrollbar

New in v1.1 — previously the app relied entirely on the browser's native
scrollbar styling, which varied across platforms and ignored the project's
semantic color tokens. The rules below apply to both the native page scrollbar
(controlled via global CSS) and the custom Radix `ScrollArea` component.

- **Thumb color:** `border-strong` token (see §1.1, §2.1) — the same token used
  for overlay borders. In light mode this resolves to `#D1D5DB`; in dark mode
  to `#3A3F46`. The value updates dynamically with the theme because it
  references `var(--color-border-strong)`, which itself chains through
  `rgb(var(--border-strong))` — never a hardcoded hex.
- **Track:** transparent. The scrollbar should feel like it materialises only
  when scrolling, not occupy permanent visual space.
- **Width:** slim — `6px` for the native scrollbar (via `scrollbar-width: thin`
  in Firefox and `width: 6px` in WebKit), `w-1.5` for the Radix `ScrollBar`
  component. This is intentionally thinner than the standard platform default
  (~12–16px) to match the IDE-like density of the UI (§Overview).
- **Thumb hover:** `secondary` token (`#E2E8F0` light / `#334155` dark) — a
  slight brightening in both modes so the thumb gives hover feedback without
  requiring a separate hover color variable.
- **Radix ScrollArea** (`src/components/ui/scroll-area.tsx`) wraps content in a
  `ScrollAreaPrimitive.Viewport` and renders its own `ScrollBar` with the thumb
  coloured by `bg-border-strong`. This is used in the FolderSidebar
  (`FolderSidebar.tsx`) and any panel where content overflows within a fixed
  container.
- **Native page scrollbar** (`src/index.css`) is styled globally with
  `scrollbar-color` / `scrollbar-width` for Firefox and `::-webkit-scrollbar`
  pseudo-elements for Chromium browsers. These rules are scoped to `<html>` so
  they affect only the document-level scroll, not third-party widgets or nested
  scrollable containers.

```css
/* Firefox */
html {
  scrollbar-color: var(--color-border-strong) transparent;
  scrollbar-width: thin;
}

/* Chromium (Chrome, Safari, Edge) */
html::-webkit-scrollbar { width: 6px; height: 6px; }
html::-webkit-scrollbar-track { background: transparent; }
html::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
  background: var(--color-border-strong);
  border-radius: 9999px;
}
html::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:hover {
  background: var(--color-secondary);
}
```

```tsx
// Radix ScrollArea — src/components/ui/scroll-area.tsx
<ScrollAreaPrimitive.ScrollAreaThumb
  className="relative flex-1 rounded-full bg-border-strong"
/>
```

## 6.12 Form Field Layout

New in v1.2 — formalizes the label+input pairing pattern that was previously
undefined, leading to inconsistent spacing and alignment across forms.

- **Layout:** Labels sit left of their input on a shared row, right-aligned
  mentally but implemented as a flex row with `justify-between`. The input
  group is constrained to `max-w-sm` so fields don't stretch edge-to-edge.
- **Label token:** always `text-label-ui text-primary` (Geist, 13px, Medium,
  §1.2). Never use `text-body-ui` for a label — it creates visual confusion
  between the label and the field value.
- **Input token:** use the `Input` or `SelectTrigger` components directly.
  They already apply `bg-surface`, `border-border-subtle`, and
  `focus-visible:ring-brand-primary` per the system.
- **Grouping:** related fields are wrapped in a `SectionGroup` — a container
  with a small icon + `text-caption-ui text-secondary` header label, then
  fields indented with `pl-5` to establish visual hierarchy without relying
  on borders or background changes.
- **Section dividers:** between unrelated field groups, use a thin
  `border-t border-border-subtle` rule. This is the only horizontal divider
  in the system — never use `<hr>` (hard to style consistently across
  themes) or background color shifts to separate sections.
- **Inline errors:** `border-danger` on the input + `text-brand-danger` helper
  below the field (per §6.4). The helper text is `text-caption-ui`.
- **Disabled fields:** `opacity-50 cursor-not-allowed` is handled by the
  Input/Select components. Never add a separate disabled label.
- **Enter to submit:** fields that trigger an action (preset name, custom model
  name) respond to Enter via `onKeyDown` — don't require the user to click a
  button if they're already typing in a single-field form.

```tsx
// FieldRow — the standard label + input pairing
function FieldRow({ label, htmlFor, children }) {
  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-between gap-4">
      <label htmlFor={htmlFor} className="shrink-0 text-label-ui text-primary">
        {label}
      </label>
      <div className="w-full max-w-sm">{children}</div>
    </div>
  )
}

// SectionGroup — groups related fields under a shared header
function SectionGroup({ icon: Icon, title, children }) {
  return (
    <div className="flex flex-col gap-3">
      <div className="flex items-center gap-2">
        <Icon className="h-3.5 w-3.5 text-muted" />
        <span className="text-caption-ui text-secondary font-semibold">{title}</span>
      </div>
      <div className="flex flex-col gap-4 pl-5">{children}</div>
    </div>
  )
}
```

## 6.13 Settings Page Layout

Settings pages follow a different layout from the main generator dashboard.
Avoid reusing the generator's dense card layout in settings — settings need
more whitespace and clearer section boundaries.

- **Container width:** `max-w-3xl` (768px) instead of `xl` (1280px). Settings
  forms with long text inputs feel stretched at 1280px; 768px keeps line
  lengths readable while being wider than `max-w-2xl` (672px) which feels
  cramped for field+label rows.
- **Bottom padding:** `pb-12` on the page container. Apply/import/export
  actions at the bottom of a tall settings card need breathing room before
  the page end — `pb-6` is insufficient here.
- **Card header icons:** every settings card gets a `CardHeader` with an
  8×8 icon container (`.rounded-lg bg-brand-primary/10`) + icon. This gives
  each card a visual anchor that distinguishes it by glance:
  - Preferences → `Palette`
  - AI Config → `Cpu`
- **SectionGroup** (§6.12) replaces sub-cards for field grouping within a
  settings card. Do not nest `Card` components — use `SectionGroup` +
  `SectionDivider` instead.
- **Action buttons:** group primary actions (Apply, Test Connection) with
  the fields they act on, not at the very bottom of a long card. Place them
  after the last related field group, before saved presets.
- **List items** (presets, saved configs) use the `group` pattern (§6.12)
  with actions revealed on hover. Never show delete/load buttons at full
  opacity on every item — it creates visual clutter.
- **Empty state:** use the `EmptyState` component (§6.6), not a dashed-border
  div. The empty state is an invitation to act, so include an action button.
- **Import:** use a hidden `<input type="file">` triggered by a `<label>` or
  button click (never a raw `<input>` visible on the page). Read the file as
  text and open the import dialog with pre-filled content.

## 6.14 List Items (Presets, Saved Items)

- **Container:** `rounded-lg border border-border-subtle bg-surface px-4 py-3`.
  The item starts with a subtle border and flat surface — elevation comes from
  interaction, not resting state.
- **Resting state:** title in `text-label-ui text-primary`, metadata in
  `text-caption-ui text-muted`. Two distinct text roles in one item.
- **Hover state:** `hover:border-border-strong hover:bg-surface-hover` with
  `transition-all`. The border strengthens and the background shifts to signal
  interactivity.
- **Action reveal:** action buttons inside a `div` with
  `opacity-0 transition-opacity group-hover:opacity-100`. Actions are visible
  on hover (desktop) and always visible in the item's focused/active state.
  On touch devices, the items reveal actions on first tap or show them
  persistently via a "more" button — test both.
- **Destructive action:** the delete button uses `text-muted hover:text-brand-danger`
  instead of showing red at rest. Color-coded danger appears only on hover to
  avoid alarming the user during normal browsing.
- **No icon-only buttons without aria-label:** per §6.8, every icon button
  gets an `aria-label`. Tooltip is not a substitute.

```tsx
<div className="group flex items-center justify-between rounded-lg border border-border-subtle bg-surface px-4 py-3 transition-all hover:border-border-strong hover:bg-surface-hover">
  <div className="flex flex-col gap-0.5">
    <span className="text-label-ui text-primary">{name}</span>
    <span className="text-caption-ui text-muted">{metadata}</span>
  </div>
  <div className="flex gap-1.5 opacity-0 transition-opacity group-hover:opacity-100">
    <Button variant="outline" size="sm" className="h-8 gap-1.5 px-2.5 text-caption-ui">
      {action}
    </Button>
    <Button
      variant="ghost"
      size="sm"
      className="h-8 w-8 p-0 text-muted hover:text-brand-danger"
      aria-label="Delete"
    >
      <Trash2 className="h-3.5 w-3.5" />
    </Button>
  </div>
</div>
```

## 6.15 Grain Overlay & Texture

New in v1.3 — a subtle noise texture overlays the entire application to add
visual depth without distracting from content.

- **Position:** fixed-position pseudo-element on `body::before`, covering the
  full viewport.
- **Z-index:** `1` (see §1.3), rendering above the background but below all
  interactive content (dropdowns, modals, toasts at `z-sticky` and above).
- **Pointer events:** `none` — the overlay is purely visual and must not
  interfere with clicking through to underlying elements.
- **Opacity:** `0.028` in light mode, `0.04` in dark mode — subtle enough to
  be perceptible only on close inspection, sufficient to break up color
  banding.
- **Implementation:** a data-URI SVG using `feTurbulence` with `type="fractalNoise"`,
  `baseFrequency="0.8"`, `numOctaves="4"`, applied as a `background-size: 256px`
  repeating pattern.

```css
/* Light mode */
body::before {
  content: "";
  position: fixed;
  inset: 0;
  background-image: url("data:image/svg+xml,...");
  background-size: 256px;
  opacity: 0.028;
  z-index: 1;
  pointer-events: none;
}

/* Dark mode override */
[data-theme="dark"] body::before {
  opacity: 0.04;
}
```

## 6.16 Card Spotlight Border

New in v1.3 — interactive cards gain a luminous border effect that follows the
cursor position, providing visual feedback on hover.

- **Utility class:** `.card-spotlight` applies to any interactive card component.
- **Effect:** a `::after` pseudo-element with a `radial-gradient` centered at
  `--mouse-x`/`--mouse-y` CSS custom properties, using `brand-primary/6` color,
  fading to transparent at 40% radius.
- **States:** opacity `0` at rest, `1` on hover — smooth transition via
  `transition-opacity`.
- **Pointer events:** `none` — the effect is purely decorative.
- **Hook:** `useSpotlightBorder` in `src/hooks/useSpotlightBorder.ts` listens to
  `document mousemove`, throttles via `requestAnimationFrame`, and sets
  `--mouse-x`/`--mouse-y` on each `.card-spotlight` element relative to its
  bounding rect.
- **Applied to:** `GeneratorForm` card, `PromptCard`, `HistoryList` item cards,
  `QuickStats` metric tiles, `RecentPrompts` prompt tiles, and Home page
  feature cards.

```tsx
// Hook usage in component
const spotlightRef = useSpotlightBorder();

<div ref={spotlightRef} className="card-spotlight rounded-xl border ...">
  {/* content */}
</div>
```

---

## 7. Layout & Spacing

- **Container:** max-width `1280px` (`xl` breakpoint, §1.5) for the main
  generator dashboard, so text lines stay readable.
- **Sidebar:** fixed `260px`. Below `lg` (§1.5), it collapses into a glass
  drawer at `z-drawer`, following the overlay rules in §4.
- **Spacing rhythm:** `lg` (24px) between major sections (e.g. Input Form →
  Output Results) so the interface has room to breathe.
- **Settings container:** `max-w-3xl` (768px) — wider than the default
  `max-w-2xl` to accommodate label+input field rows without wrapping, but
  narrower than the dashboard `xl` to maintain readability on longer fields.
- **Card header icons:** always pair a card title with a semantic icon in an
  8×8 rounded box at `bg-brand-primary/10`. This visually separates cards
  in a multi-card layout without relying on background color changes.

**Layout updates (v1.3):**

- **Viewport height:** `min-h-dvh` on the main layout container to fix iOS
  Safari's viewport jump on address bar hide/show.
- **Main content padding:** tightened to `p-4 md:p-6` (was `p-6`) for denser
  information density.
- **Header:** reduced to `h-14`. Background changed to `bg-surface/80
  backdrop-blur-md`. App name uses `text-label-ui font-semibold tracking-tight`
  instead of `text-heading`.
- **Sidebar:** navigation container uses `gap-0.5` and `p-3`. Nav items use
  `rounded-lg` (was `rounded-md`). Active items get a left accent bar
  (`absolute left-0 h-5 w-0.5 rounded-full bg-brand-primary`). Icons transition
  to `text-brand-primary` when active, `text-muted group-hover:text-primary`
  when inactive. Mobile overlay uses `bg-black/60 backdrop-blur-sm`.
  Background: `bg-surface/95 backdrop-blur-md`.

## 8. Do's and Don'ts

### Do

- **Do** use `bg-app` for the outermost container, `bg-surface` for
  cards/panels.
- **Do** use `backdrop-blur-md` on dropdowns so underlying text never visually
  collides with menu items.
- **Do** reach for a Radix/Shadcn primitive before hand-rolling an interactive
  pattern (§5.1).
- **Do** test every new component in both `data-theme="light"` and
  `data-theme="dark"`, with keyboard-only navigation, before merging.
- **Do** use stagger animations (`animate-stagger-*`) for sequential entry
  effects on hero elements, feature grids, and list items.
- **Do** apply `btn-press` class to primary action buttons for tactile feedback.

### Don't

- **Don't** use standard shadows (`shadow-md`) on flat resting cards — rely on
  `border-subtle`. Shadows are reserved for floating overlays at their `z-*`
  layer.
- **Don't** use loading spinners for text generation — streaming text and
  skeletons only.
- **Don't** use the monospace font for UI buttons or navigation — reserved
  for AI outputs, prompt syntax, and scores.
- **Don't** define a new color value without adding it to §2.1 and checking
  contrast — no inline one-off hex values, ever.
- **Don't** ship a custom dropdown/accordion/modal when a Radix/Shadcn
  primitive already covers the pattern.
- **Don't** leave a `Switch`/toggle on the primitive's default un-themed
  colors — always wire `checked`/`unchecked` to `brand-primary` and
  `bg-surface-hover` per §6.7, never plain white/transparent.
- **Don't** ship an icon-only button without `aria-label` — a tooltip alone
  doesn't make it accessible (§6.8).
- **Don't** use `text-muted-foreground` — this is not a DESIGN.md token. Use
  `text-muted` (which maps to the `text-muted` semantic token in §2.3).
  `text-muted-foreground` is a shadcn default that bypasses the project's
  semantic color system.
- **Don't** show destructive action buttons (delete, remove) at full color at
  rest — use `text-muted` and transition to `text-brand-danger` on hover to
  avoid alarming the user during normal browsing (§6.12).
- **Don't** put success confirmation text in exclamation marks. Be confident,
  not loud: "Configuration applied" not "Configuration applied!" (§8
  Content rules).
- **Don't** leave action buttons permanently visible on list items in a
  settings page — reveal them on hover via `group-hover:opacity-100` to
  reduce visual noise (§6.12).
- **Don't** use all-caps labels — labels should be sentence case. The
  `SectionGroup` header uses `text-caption-ui text-secondary font-semibold`
  without `uppercase` or `tracking-wide`.
- **Don't** let the grain overlay (`z-grain: 1`) visually interfere with
  modals, dropdowns, or toasts — these components render at `z-sticky` (10)
  and above, ensuring proper stacking order.
